Tables in the database:

products(product_id, name, category, price)
customers(customer_id, name, region, signup_date)
orders(order_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, discount, order_date)

Notes:
- order_date is text in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
- To get revenue for an order: price * quantity * (1 - discount).
- Join orders to products via product_id, and to customers via customer_id.
- Use strftime('%Y-%m', order_date) to group by month.
